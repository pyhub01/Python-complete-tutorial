Sklearn is one of the most commonly used machine learning libraries. If you have any questions, you should consult the official sklearn documentation.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is worth noting that machine learning does not support large-scale data. If your data exceeds a certain size, then machine learning may not be able to solve it (it takes a few hours to run, or needs to use more than 100GB of memory), At this time you need to use a deep learning framework.

Keras is a secondary encapsulation of tensorflow, so if you have more in-depth questions, you should ask tensorflow

Pytorch is also our very important deep learning library. Keras also supports packaging with pytorch as the bottom layer, so if you are considering using pytorch then you should take a look up in pytorch.

When you are doing visualization, are you confused about not knowing what chart to use, or you don’t know how to display the data?
