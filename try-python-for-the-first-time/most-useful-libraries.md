# 1 most useful libraries

If you download python, there are some commonly used libraries that can be installed, so as to avoid some inexplicable errors in the future.

The method of installing the library was mentioned before.&#x20;

First, check the system environment variables and system path when python is installed (if you forget it at the time, you can overwrite the installation again)

After searching cmd in win10, the command prompt will open.

Enter the following code to install these libraries. If your internet speed is slow, you may need to wait for a while.

### numpy

numpy is a data processing library, very commonly used, basically every program needs to be used, so installing numpy can be said to be the first step in python programming

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### matplotlib

matplotlib is a plotting library for python, which is quite common and must be installed.

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### pandas

pandas is a very commonly used library, which is also used for data processing and data visualization.

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### sklearn

The most commonly used machine learning library.

```bash
pip install sklearn
```

### seaborn

If you want your output to look good, then seaborn is the best choice. This library has made many optimizations to the python visual interface.

```bash
pip install seaborn
```



Some database connection libraries are also very commonly used, but they are not used here yet. I am going to explain them in the database chapter.
