# 1 Install python

Python is divided into python2 and python3. Python2 uses an older programming language design scheme, which is no longer suitable for the current high-level programming language design ideas. Therefore, in order to remove the burden from old version, python3 did not consider backward compatibility when designing.&#x20;

Python workshop officially announced that on January 1, 2020, the update of Python 2 will be discontinued.

So in this tutorial, the latest version of python3 will be used for teaching.

First we need to install python3.

Before starting to install python3, I suggest you take a look at the official python website.

When I wrote this tutorial, python has been updated to version 3.10, but I strongly recommend that you do not use the latest version of python because there are still many package compatibility issues that need to be resolved in this version. So I suggest that you use the last version of 3.8, which is python3.8.10.

At the bottom of this page is the download options and file download address. You can choose different installation packages according to your system. If your system is win10, then I recommended you to choose Windows installer (64-bit), and then you only need to follow the prompts step by step Just install it.

If you are a win10 user but you cannot find the download link, this is the exe download link.

There are two things to pay attention to when installing:

1. You should check Add python3 to the windows environment variable (system PATH), so you don't need to manually add environment variables (a rather troublesome thing).
2. You should choose to lift the system's longest string (256 bytes) limit at the end of the installation, so that you will have no problem installing any packages in the future.

The above is the way to install the simplest version of the python3 graphical interpreter
