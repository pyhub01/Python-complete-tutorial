# Harmonic mean

We have explained what an average is before, so today we will explain the other most important average in probability statistics: the harmonic average.

For example, Some students study literature and mathematics. We want to give these students a comprehensive score. (We want to analyze the problem of students' partial subjects)

<mark style="color:red;">There is a student who scored 60 points in the literature test and 60 points in the math test, so his average score is 60, which does not seem very good.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">But his harmonic average score is: 2/(1/60+1/60)=60.0</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Another student scored 100 points in the literature test, but only 20 points in the math test. His average score is the same as the previous student, which is 60 points.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">But his harmonic average score is: 2/(1/100+1/20)=33.33333333333333</mark>

We can see that the second student's partial subject problem is more serious.
