# F1 score

If a factory produces a batch of products, if we improve the process level, the defective rate of the product will decrease, but the cost will also increase. If we reduce the process level, the defective rate will rise, but the cost will also decrease.

Then the technological level has entered the state of Nash equilibrium. We don’t want the level of craftsmanship to be too high, because it will make our prices unattractive, but we also don’t want too low a level of craftsmanship to cause our factories to produce mobile phones that will explode. So how should we decide?

In the previous chapter, we talked about precision and recall. If the precision is high, you need a low level of craftsmanship, and if the precision is high, you need a high level of craftsmanship. Then if we use an average (we said before that the harmonic average is suitable for dealing with such problems) to average the precision and recall, then we can find a suitable level of craftsmanship.
