Confusion matrix is one of the most important ways to observe training results in machine learning and deep learning.

After the confusion matrix is built, we can also calculate the accuracy rate, error rate, precision rate, recall rate and other evaluation parameters.



Because we deal with binary classification problems in most cases, I will start with the confusion matrix of the binary classification problem:
