# basic python programming

```python
print('12345')

a = 1 + 2
b = a
print(b)
```

Python is a simple and convenient language. If you want to program in python, you first need to create a new notepad file and change the suffix to .py. In this way, you have created a new python script, and then you only need to write the python code into this script file to run it.

For example, the result of running the above code is:

```python
12345
3
>>> 
```

## tab

In C or C++ or Java, logic uses curly braces ({}) to enclose a block of code. In python, use tab, if you don't use tab correctly, you will get an error.

```python
add_sum = 0
for i in range(10):
    add_sum += i
    print(add_sum)
```

The above for loop code block is **grouped** using tab indentation.

If you don't use tab, then python will pop up a prompt box to report an error before running.

The result of the above code is:

```python
0
1
3
6
10
15
21
28
36
45
>>> 
```

This is the program to solve 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9.

```python
add_sum = 0
for i in range(10):
    add_sum += i
print(add_sum)
```

If you use the above code, then the for loop only includes the code to solve the sum, not the printing code. The printing code is outside the loop, so it will only be printed once, which is the final result:

```parigp
45
>>> 
```

## python line

Each instruction in python is called a line of python.



## Blank line









## operator
