# some additions

## assignment symbol

```python
>>> a = 4
>>> a += 3
>>> a
7
>>> 
```

a += 3 and a = a + 3 have the same meaning. This is an auto-increment operation.

Unlike C++ or Java, there is no such way as a++ in python, if you want a to increment by 1, then you need a += 1

All operators support auto-increment:

```python
>>> a = 4

>>> a %= 2
>>> a
0

>>> a += 3
>>> a
3

>>> a -= 5
>>> a
-2

>>> a /= 4
>>> a
-0.5
>>> a *= 10
>>> a
-5.0

>>> a //= 6
>>> a
-1.0

>>> 
```
