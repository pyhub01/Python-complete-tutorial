# Fibonacci sequence

In a previous lesson I explained how to use recursion to calculate the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)



for i in range(1, 11):
    print(fib(i))
```

The result obtained is as follows:

```python
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
>>> 
```
