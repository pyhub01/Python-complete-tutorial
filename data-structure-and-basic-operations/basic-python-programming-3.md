# basic python programming 3

In today's tutorial I'll cover basic logic and loops:

## Conditional control

The if statement is used for conditional control in python.

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i, end='\t')
    if i == 3:
        print('this is 3')
    elif i == 5:
        print('this is 5')
    elif i == 7:
        print('this is 7')
    else:
        print('not important')
```
