# 2 Python data structure

The following code is completed in the interactive interface (you can also write the code into the script, you need to add print(...) to display):

The interactive command prompt of python is:

```python
>>>
```

The content entered after this symbol will run in real time and display the results of the run.

For example, if we enter 2 it will produce the following changes:

```python
>>> 2
2
>>> 
```

We enter 2, and python reads 2 as a number, and then returns the entered number, which is 2.

What if we enter a Formula?

```python
>>> 1+2
3
>>> 
```

Python will calculate the corresponding value.

Python contains algorithms that can perform scientific calculations. For example, if you enter:

```python
>>> 7+3*7/5+5/3+(11*9+2)/5
33.06666666666666
>>> 
```
