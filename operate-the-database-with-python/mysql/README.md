# MySQL

MySQL is one of the most commonly used databases.&#x20;

MySQL is a relational database, which means that MySQL is a data table, just like a data table in excel, MySQL is a lot of grids. This also determines that MySQL cannot effectively accommodate the Sparse data table, because the blank grid will cause a lot of space waste.

But MySQL and sql statements are still very important.

In this chapter, I will introduce how to install sql database and use MySQL database in python.
