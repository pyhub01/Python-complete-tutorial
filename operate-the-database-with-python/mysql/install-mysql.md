# Install MySQL

There are many tutorials on the Internet for installing MySQL, so I won't go into too much detail here.

An important point is, please remember your MySQL initial password, and add MySQL to the environment variable.

The new version of MySQL has many problems, including the way changing the password is changed, sometimes unable to connect, etc. These problems may not be easy to find a solution to, maybe it is better to use the old version of MySQL.
