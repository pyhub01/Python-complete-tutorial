# 0 About this book

![python logo](.gitbook/assets/python.png)

I have always wanted to write a book, but I have never had the opportunity and I don't know what to write. Until recently I learned python and found that it is a very interesting programming language, so I decided to present all the content I have learned before using python.

The knowledge I learned includes basic programming, data structures and algorithms, signal processing, deep learning, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and some mathematical methods. I will try to describe these contents in the simplest way with pictures and animations.

I have read some programming books before, and I found that most of them are boring. Some books are similar to dictionaries. Such reference books are meaningless to beginners, because even if they have read them, they will forget the contents of the books. Some other books are similar to learning python in 10 hours. Such fast-track books don't contain many important things. Similarly, this type of book you will forget it after reading.

In today's world, there is a popular trend to learn by doing a large number of exercises. Of course, this is a good method, but if you have not acquired enough knowledge, how would you improve your level in such a large number of exercises?

In my opinion, learning abstract knowledge is the most important thing, much more important than doing a lot of practice. Of course, if you want to learn a knowledge well, you need a good book, a tutorial which understand you, so I am going to do such a thing which is to write a simple and easy-to-understand reference book to teach you how to use python to do what you need.

In this book, I will try to cite a lot of examples to make learning easier. There will be a lot of illustrations and examples in this book to help everyone understand programming ideas and methods.

The most important thing in programming is thinking. You must have a clear idea to solve the problem, so that your program can be efficient and concise.

I will also try some leetcode topics, I hope these will be helpful to your programming, scientific research and job hunting.

Okay, that's all I want to say, let's start our python programming!
