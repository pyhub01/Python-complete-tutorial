# 0 About this book

I have always wanted to write a book, but I have never had the opportunity and I don't know what to write. Until recently I learned python and found that it is a very interesting programming language, so I decided to present all the content I have learned before using python.

The knowledge I learned includes basic programming, data structures and algorithms, signal processing, deep learning, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and some mathematical methods. I will try to describe these contents in the simplest way with pictures and animations.

I have read some books before, and I found that most of them are boring. Some books are similar to dictionaries. Such reference books are meaningless to beginners, because even if they have read them, they will forget the contents of the books. Some other books are similar to learning python in 10 hours. Such fast-track books don't contain many important things. Similarly, this type of book you will forget it after reading it.
