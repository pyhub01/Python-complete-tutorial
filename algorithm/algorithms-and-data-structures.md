# Algorithms and Data Structures

Algorithms and data structures are very hard parts of all programming.

But algorithms and data structures are the most important parts of all programming. When you are programming, you will inevitably encounter such a problem: Now there are students in a class, everyone has names, ages, grades, how should I store these data? If I need to rank all students by grades, what should I do?

These all require data structures to be stored and sorted by algorithms. Different endings will take up computer resources of different sizes, including memory size, hard disk size, calculation amount and calculation time.

We hope that the amount of calculation is small, the resources occupied are small, and the program is simple and not prone to errors.

That's what this chapter is about.
